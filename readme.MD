# Pytorch Random

### This is a repository where i implement some basic to advanced NN models using Pytorch. The main goal is to understand the Pytorch library and how to use it to build NN models.

## In This Repository:
- Pytorch Bacis (0)
- PT workflow (01)
- PT Classifications (02)
- PT cnn models and torchvision (03)
- PT transfer learning (04)
- PT Modularization - py file implementation from ipynb
- PT tracking, logging and experiments (05)
- PT transformers
- PT RNNs
    - PT LSTM
    - PT GRU
- PT UNets
